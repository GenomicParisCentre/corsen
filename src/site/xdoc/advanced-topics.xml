			<subsection name="Filtering input particles">

				<p>Input particles can be filtered by setting with an
					expression
					the "filter" fields for particles A and B in the
					"Particles"
					tab in Corsen Settings.</p>

				<p>The expression must use the Javascript syntax. Several
					variable are defined for the test:</p>

				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Variable name</th>
						<th>Comment</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>area</td>
						<td>Area of the particle</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>density</td>
						<td>Density of the particle</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>intensity</td>
						<td>Intensity of the particle</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>sphericity</td>
						<td>Sphericity of the particle</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>volume</td>
						<td>Volume of the particle</td>
					</tr>
				</table>

				<p>Here an example:</p>
				<code>
					intensity &gt; 10000 &amp;&amp; volume &gt; 30
</code>

            <subsection name="Filtering particles shown in 3D visualization">
            
            <p>Unlike the filtering of input particles, the filtering of particle in the 3D visualization is set by pressing on "<b>Filter</b>" button in the 3D View tab.</p>
            <p>The expression system is the same as in the previous topic,except the name of the variable for filtering distances (see table below). For particles A and B, use the previously described variables.</p>   
            
               
                
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>distance</td><td>Distance (can be negative) 
                    between a particle A and a particle B</td></tr>

            <subsection name="Choose a particle type">
            
            <p>Different biological localization issue can be tackle by Corsen thanks to
             several distance calculation options that should be chosen depending on the shape 
             of objects to be analyzed.</p> 
            <p>Please, before starting Corsen analysis carefully consider these 
            different options.</p> 
            
            <p>You should keep in mind that distances will be always calculated from particles A 
            archors to particles B archors and that these archors will be defined by the selected 
            particles processing option (see table below).</p>
            
            <p>Corsen is a very flexible tool, you can select a particle 
            type in order to choose the algorithm used in the distances 
            computation. The following table summary the characteristics of the
            available particles type.</p>
            
            <table>

                        surface of the particles</td>
                        <td>All the points of the cuboids that are at the surface 
                        of the particles. If the archor of particles A is 
                        in a particle B, the distance will be negative</td>
                    </tr>
                    
                </table>
                
                <p>If you want to add another type of particle, you can do it 
                by adding your particle type to Corsen source code. See the
                <a href="download-src.html">download source section</a> 
                to download Corsen source code and see compiling instructions.</p>

            <subsection name="Multithreading">
            
                <p>The current generation of processors often contains two or mores 
                core that allow to do easily parallel computations. Corsen can take 
                usage of the many core to increase the speed of distance computation. 
                By default no thread are used to compute the distance, you can enable 
                it in the computation tab of Corsen setting. If you choose to set the 
                number of threads to automatic, this number will be equals to the number 
                of processors/cores in your computer.</p>
