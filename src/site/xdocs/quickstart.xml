            <subsection name="Launch a single computation">
            
                <p>To execute the calculation of the distances, you
                 must select input files using the menus <b>File</b> /
                 <b>Open particles A</b> et <b>File</b> / <b>Open 
                 particles B</b>.  Then you can launch the compution by 
                 pressing the <b>Launch</b> button. A dialogbox will appear 
                 to ask you the prefix of the outputs files. Once this step is 
                 accomplished, the computation will run.</p>
                 
                 <p>While the computation, you can monitor the progress of 
                 Corsen with the progress bar the log on the main tab.</p>
                 <p>When the calculation is complete, the results, 3D View and 
                 History tab will be updated.</p>
            
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="3D visualisation only">
            
                <p>To only use the 3D visualisation functionality of Corsen, 
                follow the same steps that if you want launch a single computation
                but press on <b>3D View</b> instead of <b>Launch</b>.</p> 
            
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="Use Corsen in batch mode">
            
                <p>If you want to use Corsen on several images in the aim to do
                statistical work, it will be more easier to use Corsen in batch 
                mode. Before launching Corsen you must defined in the Particles 
                tab of the settings of Corsen, the prefixes of the files to use 
                (for each type of particles). Then select the directory of the file 
                to analyse with menu <b>File</b> / <b>Open a directory</b>, and
                press the <b>launch</b> button to run the computation.</p>
                
                <p>As for a single computation all the tabs will be update during the 
                progress the calculation of data.</p>
            
            </subsection>


            <subsection name="The Results tab">
            
            <p>The result tab contains informations about the last cell that
            has been analyzed by Corsen. You can select type of information to
            display with the combobox at top of the tab.</p>

            </table>
            
            <p>In this tab, Corsen allow you to save filtered particles (the 
            filter can be set in the application settings) and result files. The type of 
            particles to save or result to save is selected with the same 
            combobox used to choose result table and graph to show.</p>
            
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="3D visualisation">
            
                <p>In this tab, a 3D visualization of the last particles A and B 
                analyzed is displayed. For each type of particles you can select 
                the visualization mode :</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>No visualization</li>
                    <li>Standard visualization of the particles</li>
                    <li>Preprocessed particles (cuboids)</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>In addition, two checkboxes allow to show minumum distances and 
                the barycenter of particles. Unlike the input filtering, the filtering view in 
                this tab will only have effects on the 3D visualization.</p>
            
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="The History tab">
            
            <p>The History tab summaries the results of all previous Corsen 
            computation. The table show for each previous calculation, the 
            inputs files and a result from Coren computation. The result (mean,
            median, min, max) to show can be selected with the combobox.</p>
            
            <p>The list of result type to display, there is an item called "custom". 
            The custom statistic represents the percent of distances that pass a test. 
            The expression of the test is defined in Corsen settings.</p>
            
            
            <p>The plots on the bottom of the tab show a boxplot and a 
            distribution for the table values. The plots are drawn if there is
            more than 2 values in the table. The table can be cleared by press
            the clear button.</p>
