			<p>
				Corsen like other image analysis tools need preprocessed images as
				input to get optimal quality results. Many preprocessing filters
				exists in image analysis:
				<ul>
					<li>Adjust brightness/contrast</li>
					<li>Removing background/dust/saturated pixels</li>
					<li>Resizing image</li>
					<li>...</li>
				</ul>

			<subsection name="Preprocessing use in Corsen article">

			<p>To obtain data published in Corsen article (jourdren et al.,
				2009), we developed an image processing procedure for automatic
				extraction of both small particles and aggregates that could not be
				segmented together using a unique threshold.</p>
				
				<p> It consists in a
				Laplacien filter (r=2) allowing to enhance tiny objects signal
				followed by a median filter (r=2 for mitochondria, r=1 for mRNA).</p>
				<p>
				The resulting image is added to the initial one subjected to a high
				increase of the minimal grey value keeping only the intense and
				large aggregates that could have been removed by the Laplacien
				filter.</p><p> Automation is based on cell histogram calculation and
				histogram adjustment prior filters application. Depending on objects
				occupancy, the background threshold grey (minimal grey value) value
				is chosen as follow: min=m+c.s with min, minimal gray value; m, cell
				median intensity; s, cell intensiy standard deviation; and c, a
				coefficient determined by object occupancy.</p>
				
				<p> Typically, before
				Laplacien filter we took c = -2 for mitochondria objects and c =
				[-1_1] for RNA objects depending on their expression level. For the
				image used to keep only the strongest particles removed by this
				filter the c value is 2 units raised.</p>
				
				<p>This method is available as a
				macro for ImageJ. This leads to an enhanced image
				that can be submitted to isodata automatic threshold and then used,
				after eroding (r=2 for mitochondria, r=1 for mRNA), as a mask for
				the initial image. 3D segmentation algorithm is therefore used
				removing only pixels whose values are zero.</p>

			<p>
				Our
				<a href="./image_processing.txt">image processing macro</a>
				can be freely downloaded and use. As a sample we provide a demonstration cell
				<a href="./demo_image.tiff">image</a>
				and its cell
				<a href="./demo_mask.tiff">mask</a>. The <a href="./apply_mask.txt">second script</a> used to apply the 
			particle mask is also available.</p>
			
			<p>The following table summaries the steps of prepropressing we apply on our images before launching Corsen plug-in.</p>
