    <section name="How can I contribute to Corsen ?">
    

      <p>Corsen is a free software project. Everybody is encouraged to contribute to Corsen. There are lots of ways in which you can help to continue Corsen:</p>

        <li>Testing new versions</li>
        <li>Submitting bug reports to the mailing list</li>
	<!--<li>Writing documentation or help files</li>-->
	  </ul>
      <p>There are several places to look for more information if you want to get involved in the development. The first step is to subscribe to the mailing list. You will soon see something that can be improved or added.</p>

    <section name="How do I commit a bug report?">
      <p>There is actualy no automatic bug tracking system available like Bugzilla for Corsen. So, to report a bug, you must send your report on the <a href="mail-lists.html">mailing-list</a>.</p>
    </section>

<!--    <section name="How do I get access to the CVS?">
      <p>The Corsen project uses the CVS system to develop the core parts of the software. Due to security reasons, we cannot open freely this cvs server to external users of the ENS. So if you want contribute to the core of Corsen, you can send patches to the developer using the developers <a href="mail-lists.html">mailing-list</a>.</p>
